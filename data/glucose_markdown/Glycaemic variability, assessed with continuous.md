# 24 Abstract  

# 25 Background  

26 Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) provide high-frequency information regarding daily glucose   
27 variation and are recognised as effective for improving glycaemic control in individuals living with   
28 diabetes. Despite increased use in individuals with non-diabetic blood glucose concentrations   
29 (euglycemia), their utility as a health tool in this population remains unclear.   
30   
31 Objectives   
32 To characterise variation in time in range (TIR) and glycaemic variability in large populations without   
33 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance; describe associations between CGM-derived glycaemic metrics   
34 and metabolic and cardiometabolic health traits; identify key diet and lifestyle factors associated with   
35 TIR and glycaemic variability.   
36   
37 Design   
38 Glycaemic variability (coefficient of variation) and time spent in both the ADA secondary target range   
39 (TIRADA; $3.9{-}7.8\ \mathrm{mmol/L})$ and a more stringent range (TIR3.9-5.6; $3.9{-}5.6\ \mathrm{mmol/L})$ were calculated   
40 during free-living in PREDICT 1, PREDICT 2, and PREDICT 3 euglycaemic community-based   
41 volunteer cohorts. Associations between CGM derived glycaemic metrics, markers of cardiometabolic   
42 health, diet (food frequency questionnaire and logged diet records), diet-habits, and lifestyle were   
43 explored.   
44   
45 Results   
46 Data from $\scriptstyle\mathrm{N}=4135$ participants (Mean $\boxed{\begin{array}{r l}\end{array}}$ SD; Age: $47\sqcap12\,\mathrm{y}$ ; Sex: $83\%$ Female, BMI: $27\boxed{6}\mathrm{{kg}}/\mathrm{{m}}^{2}$ ).   
47 Median glycaemic variability was $14.8\%$ (IQR $12.6–17.6\%)$ ), median TIRADA was $95.8\%$ (IQR 89.6-   
48 $98.6\%)$ and TIR3.9-5.6 was $75.0\%$ ( $\mathrm{IQR}\,64.6–82.8\%)$ ). Greater TIR3.9-5.6 was associated with lower HbA1c,   
49 ASCVD 10y risk and HOMA-IR (all $\mathsf{p}<0.05)$ ). Lower glycaemic variability was associated with lower   
50 $\%$ energy derived from carbohydrate $(\mathrm{r_{s}};0.17,\mathrm{p}<0.01)$ ), ultra-processed foods (NOVA 4, $\%$ EI; $\mathrm{r}_{\mathrm{s}}\mathrm{:}\,0.12$ ,   
51 ${\mathfrak{p}}=0.01^{\prime}$ ) and a longer overnight fasting duration $(\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{{s}}};\,-0.10,\,\mathbf{p}=0.01)$ ).   
52   
53 Conclusions   
54 A stringent TIR target provides sensitivity to detect changes in HOMA-IR, ASCVD 10 y risk and   
55 HbA1c that were not detected using ADA secondary targets. Associations among TIR, glycaemic   
56 variability, dietary intake (e.g. carbohydrate and protein) and habits (e.g. nocturnal fasting duration)   
57 highlight potential strategic targets to improve glycaemic metrics derived from continuous glucose   
58 monitors.  

# 59 Introduction  

60 Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) provide real time data of fluctuations in interstitial fluid glucose   
61 throughout the day in free-living conditions 1,2. Compared to traditional blood glucose monitoring, such   
62 as capillary fingertip or venous glucose measurements, CGMs provide high-frequency assessments of   
63 glucose variation, including magnitude, duration, and frequency of within and between-day glucose   
64 variability1. In people living with diabetes, CGMs can help improve glycaemic control3. Greater   
65 exposure to elevated postprandial glucose, indicated by time spent above range $(>\!10.0\ \mathrm{mmol/L})$ ,   
66 precedes changes in fasting glucose and HbA1c that indicate dysregulated glucose metabolism 4.   
67 Therefore, CGM-derived metrics are more discriminatory of deterioration in blood glucose control than   
68 HbA1c and are also linked to arterial wall thickening 2-7. Consequently, CGMs have become common   
69 in diabetes management, providing an effective means for detecting impaired glucose regulation and   
70 helping to set realistic treatment goals 1,2. However, the health utility of CGMs in individuals with   
71 normal glycaemia remains unclear.   
72   
73 Despite the increase in use of CGMs in individuals with euglycaemia there is currently very limited   
74 published data on glycaemic variability and health outcomes in this population. However, postprandial   
75 glucose control is relevant, even in people with euglycaemia, as a glucose concentration at 2 hours post   
76 oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) that remains above fasting levels is associated with increased risk   
77 of CVD events 8. Moreover, standard tests to assess glucose control such as fasting glucose and OGTT   
78 provide little insight into daily glucose exposure, and HbA1c lacks insight into the  dynamics of glucose   
79 fluctuations over time 4,9. In contrast, the multiple features that CGM’s measure capture the net effects   
80 of underlying physiology and acute behaviours.   
81   
82 Common CGM-derived metrics include time in range (TIR) and glycaemic variability.  Individuals   
83 without IGT or type 2 diabetes spend $93{-}99\%$ of their time within the established ADA TIR target 10-19.   
84 However, a random plasma glucose (RPG) concentration of $5.6~\mathrm{mmol/L}$ shows high sensitivity and   
85 specificity for identifying people in need of diabetes screening relative to the American Diabetes   
86 Association (ADA) and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening strategies 20-22. In   
87 contrast, individuals with euglycaemia spend ${\sim}20\%$ of time above $5.6~\mathrm{mmol/L}$ , and ${\sim}80\%$ of time   
88 between 3.3 to $5.6\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$ 10. Whilst it is possible that the above evidence may reflect glucose   
89 concentrations as an indirect marker rather than direct cause, a direct causal role of glycaemic variability   
90 as a factor in cardiometabolic health within the euglycaemic range has also not been excluded.   
91 Consequently, there is a need to examine possible relationships between glycaemic metrics and health   
92 markers within a lower specified range.   
93   
94 In addition to elucidating the role of glycemic variation in cardiometabolic health, CGMs may   
95 contribute to understanding the influence of diet and lifestyle on glycaemic control in individuals   
96 without  diabetes.  Associations  between  measures  of  glycaemic  variability,  biomarkers  of   
97 cardiometabolic health, dietary composition, and sleep quality have been recently reported 19,   
98 highlighting the potential of CGMs to identify perturbations that may influence longer term health  in   
99 individuals without diabetes. Additionally, glucose homeostasis and cardiometabolic health are   
00 influenced by other dietary and lifestyle factors such as food structure, meal timing, eating patterns, and   
01 physical activity 23-27. Additional insight can be ascertained through assessment of the relationship   
02 between a standardised OGTT to assess the relationship to glucose tolerance. Remaining questions   
03 around CGM use in populations without diabetes therefore include the exploration of any link between   
04 glycaemic metrics and cardiovascular disease intermediary risk measures, as well as dietary and   
05 lifestyle factors.   
07 The PREDICT studies, which enrolled a large number of participants who provided CGM data,  offer   
08 such an opportunity to explore the relationship between glycaemic variability and cardiometabolic   
09 health in people without diabetes. Accordingly, the aim of this research was to 1) examine variation in   
0 TIR and glycaemic variability in populations without diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance; 2)   
1 understand associations between CGM-derived glycaemic metrics with metabolic and cardiometabolic   
2 health measures; and 3) identify diet and lifestyle factors associated with TIR and glycaemic variability.   
3 We hypothesised that glycaemic variability and time in range would be associated with cardiometabolic   
4 health measures, diet, and lifestyle in the euglycaemic range.   
17 The ZOE PREDICT programme of personalised nutrition research consists of several diet intervention   
18 studies examining relationships between diet and cardiometabolic health. PREDICT 1 $(\mathfrak{n}{=}1,\!002)$   
19 (NCT03479866) was the first intervention study in the United Kingdom (UK) aiming to derive   
20 algorithms that predict an individual’s postprandial metabolic responses to specific foods 28,29. The   
21 primary outcomes were variations in serum concentrations of triglyceride, glucose and insulin in   
22 response to sequential mixed-nutrient dietary challenges during a clinical visit. Secondary outcomes   
23 included CGM, lipemic C-peptide responses assessed by dried blood spot (DBS) cards collected at   
24 home across three postprandial time points over the subsequent 13-day home-testing phase.  Ethical   
25 approval  was  granted  by  the  London-Hampstead  Research  Ethics  Committee  (approval  no.   
26 18/LO/0663) and Integrated Research Application System (no. 236407). The study was run in   
27 accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice; and all participants provided   
28 informed written consent upon enrolment. Exclusion criteria included ongoing inflammatory disease;   
29 cancer in the last three years (excluding skin cancer); long-term gastrointestinal disorders including   
30 inflammatory bowel disease or Coeliac disease, but not including irritable bowel syndrome; taking   
31 immunosuppressants or antibiotics as daily medication within the last three months; capillary glucose   
32 level of $>\!12\mathrm{{\mmol/L}}$ (or $216~\mathrm{mg/dL})$ ), or type 1 diabetes mellitus, or taking medication for type 2   
33 diabetes mellitus; currently experiencing acute clinically diagnosed depression; myocardial infarction   
34 or stroke in the last 6 months; pregnant; and vegan or experiencing an eating disorder or unwilling to   
35 consume foods that are part of the study. A group of participants who underwent additional   
36 cardiometabolic phenotyping $(n{=}49)$ were also included in this cohort. The PREDICT 1 cohort   
37 $(n{=}1002)$ and the additional cardiometabolic group $(n{=}49)$ were combined and are referred to   
38 collectively as the PREDICT 1 cohort from here out $(\mathfrak{n}{=}1,\!051)$ ).   
39 Baseline characteristics and clinical chemistry markers. Demographic and clinical measures selected   
0 for this research included: sex, age, height, weight, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol,   
1 high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) concentrations. Descriptive   
2 information including sex and age were self-reported. For body composition measures, height and   
3 weight were measured at a clinical visit (day 0). Considering clinical biochemistry: fasting venous blood   
4 samples were collected at the clinical visit; plasma glucose and serum total cholesterol, HDL-C and TG   
5 were measured by Affinity 1.0 laboratory, and whole blood HbA1c by Viapath laboratory. The 10-year   
6 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk was calculated per the 2019 ACC/AHA guidelines   
7 (19). Additional data were collected over the subsequent 13-d period at home: postprandial responses   
48 to eight standardised meals (seven in duplicate) of differing macronutrient (fat, carbohydrate, protein,   
49 and fibre) content, including an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), were measured using continuous   
0 glucose monitors (CGMs) and dried-blood-spot (DBS) analysis.   
151 CGM devices. Participants were fitted with wearable CGM devices (Abbott Freestyle Libre Pro (FSL;   
152 Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, US)) at the clinic visit (day 0). CGMs were fitted on the upper arms and   
153 covered with Opsite Flexifix adhesive film (Smith & Nephew Medical Ltd, Hull, England) for improved   
154 durability. Calibration was not required. Subcutaneous tissue interstitial fluid glucose levels were   
155 recorded every 15 minutes, and monitors captured interstitial fluid glucose concentrations between 2.2-   
156 22.2 mmol/L. PREDICT 1 participants were fully blinded to their CGM results. CGMs were worn by   
157 participants for 14 days, of which 2-4 days were free-living days (study days 10-14) meaning no   
158 standardised meals were consumed. CGM data were collected in coordinated universal time (UTC) and   
159 later adjusted to participant-specific time zones. Participants with inadequate CGM data and excluded   
160 from analysis included those with 1) ${<}2$ free-living days, $2)\!>\!1$ time zone during the free-living period,   
161 3) CGM malfunction as classified by ${>}25\%$ of readings at monitor baseline per day or ${}>\!10\%$ missing   
162 reads per day, or 4) glucose intolerance, defined by a fasting plasma glucose $\geq\!6.1\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$ $\mathrm{[110\,mg/dL)}$   
163 or oral glucose tolerance test $>7.6\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$ or 5) HbA1c levels ${>}6.5\%$ $\left(48\;\mathrm{mmol}/\mathrm{mol}\right)$ ). All interstitial   
164 fluid glucose levels are reported as means with SD. Glucose variability was measured by the coefficient   
165 of variation $(\%)$ , calculated as the average of daily CVs (SD divided by the mean). TIR was calculated   
166 based on two cut-off values: 1) the American Diabetes Association (ADA) secondary cut-offs (TIRADA;   
167 $3.9{-}7.8\;\mathrm{mmol/L})$ 2, and 2) an exploratory range TIR cut-off (TIR3.9-5.6; 3.9-5.6 mmol/L), defined by us   
168 based on previously published data 30, to visualise glycaemic variability in participants without type 1   
169 diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus or IGT.   
170   
171 Dietary data. Pre-enrollment, participants completed the European Prospective Investigation into   
172 Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to capture their past-year intake of   
173 foods 31.  Habitual food intake, energy expenditure and nutrients were ascertained from the FFQ as   
174 previously described 28. Free-living logged diet data was also collected from which food intake, energy   
175 expenditure and nutrients were collected on free-living days with concurrent CGM data. Nutrient values   
176 were obtained for 11,333 foods of 42,211 foods from the McCance and Widdowson Food and Nutrient   
177 database 32. For branded foods, nutrient information was collated from common supermarket websites.   
178 A day was excluded per participant when daily calorie intake fell outside gender specific cut-offs   
179 deemed implausible (females; 500-5000 kcal and males; $500–8000\;\mathrm{kcal})$ ). Plant based diet index scores   
180 were calculated as a measure of diet quality 33. Percentage contributions to total daily energy were   
181 calculated for protein, carbohydrate, and fat as well as unprocessed foods and ultra-processed foods   
182 using the NOVA classification system 34.   
183 Several additional diet habit variables were calculated using the free-living logged diet data. An eating   
184 occasion (EO) was defined as any occasion where a food or beverage was consumed that contained ${\geq}50$   
185 kcal and was separated in time from the preceding and succeeding EO by 30 minutes 35,36. A main meal   
186 was defined as ${\geq}400$ kcal for females and ${\geq}500$ kcal for males 37. Snacks were defined as eating   
187 occasions that were not main meals (females; $50{-}399\ \mathrm{kcal}$ , males $50{-}499\ \mathrm{kcal}_{\rightmoon}$ ). First and last eating   
188 occasion times were the time of day when the first and last eating occasion occurred $(\geq\!50\mathrm{kal})$ 38. Fasting   
189 window was calculated as the difference between the last and first eating occasion. Eating midpoint   
190 was the midpoint in time between the first and last eating occasion. All dietary habit variables were   
191 calculated for each free-living day and mean free-living values were calculated.   
192 Activity and sleep. Activity energy expenditure (AEE), sleep duration (i.e. the difference between wake   
193 and sleep onset), and efficiency (i.e. sleep duration as a percentage of time in bed) were estimated using   
194 a triaxial accelerometer (AX3, Axivity, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK) worn by participants on the non  
195 dominant wrist for the duration of the study with the exception of during water-based activities, showers   
196 and baths). Accelerometers were programmed to measure acceleration at $50\:\mathrm{Hz}$ (dynamic range of $\pm8$   
197 g). Non-wear periods were defined as either 1) a window of at least 1 hour with less than $13\;m g$ for at   
198 least 2 out of 3 axes, or 2) where 2 out of 3 axes measured less than 50 mg 28. Sleep windows were   
199 assessed using methods described elsewhere 39.   
200 PREDICT 2 and PREDICT 3 studies. PREDICT 2 $(\mathrm{n}{=}971$ ) (NCT03983733) and PREDICT 3   
201 $(\mathfrak{n}{=}4562)$ (NCT04735835) studies took place after the PREDICT 1 study had concluded. The Predict 2   
202 and 3 studies were remote interventions carried out in the United States (US). Ethical approval was   
203 granted by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board (PREDICT 2: no. 2018P00207;   
204 PREDICT 3: no. 00000971). The informed consent and ethical committee approvals covered all   
205 analyses reported here. The studies were run in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good   
206 clinical practice; and all participants provided informed written consent. Demographic information,   
207 dietary data, cardiometabolic blood biomarkers, and postprandial responses to standardized test meals   
208 were collected in PREDICT 2 and 3. Key differences from the PREDICT 1 study include; for body   
209 composition measures, height and weight were self-reported for PREDICT 2 and 3. Fasting and   
210 postprandial lipaemic responses were assessed using whole blood finger-prick samples collected at   
211 home using dried-blood spots and total cholesterol, HDL-C, TG and HbA1c were measured using Quest   
212 Diagnostics. CGMs were fitted at home by participants; PREDICT 2 participants were not informed of   
213 data availability but some participants became aware that real time CGM glucose readings were   
214 available. PREDICT 3 participants were informed that CGM glucose readings were available and could   
215 check and self-experiment as they pleased. Unblinded participants were included in analysis as they are   
216 representative of CGM use in real-world conditions.   
217 PREDICT 1, 2 and 3 cohorts were included in this analysis. The final cohorts used for this analysis,   
218 after exclusion, consists of participants without diabetes, IGT (fasting glucose $\geq\!6.1\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$ or OGTT   
219 $\geq7.6\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$ ) or HbA1C ${\geq}6.5\%$ (48 mmol⋅mol-1), with valid CGM data across ${\geq}2$ free-living days   
220 (Figure 1) $(\mathrm{N}{=}4181$ ; PREDICT 1: $\scriptstyle{\mathtt{n}=807}$ ; PREDICT 2: $\scriptstyle{\mathtt{n}=735}$ ; and PREDICT 3: $\scriptstyle\mathtt{n}=2639_{.}$ ).

Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using $R$ (version 3.4.2, $R$ Core Team). Descriptive characteristics, including baseline characteristics and fasting blood biomarkers, are summarised in Supplementary Table 5. Differences in participant characteristics and CGM glycaemic metrics  (daily glucose, glycaemic variability and TIR) were assessed between cohorts using one-way analysis of variance. Top and bottom quintiles of TIR and glycaemic variability were selected to permit stratification across sex, age, BMI, HbA1c, and lipids (total cholesterol, HDL-C and TG) and differences between quintiles were tested using Mann Whitney U tests. Correlations between dietary intakes (habitual and free-living), dietary habits or lifestyle factors (e.g. activity and sleep) and TIR and glycaemic variability were assessed using correlation analysis while adjusting for age, sex, BMI and  

235 diet quality (PDI) using the “ppcor” package. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple   
236 comparisons was applied and statistically significant thresholds were based on FDR cut-offs $(q{<}\,0.05)$   
237 40. To determine whether the number of days with CGM data influenced glycaemic metrics , we   
238 correlated incremental sampling periods of CGM data. We tested correlations between glycaemic   
239 variability and TIR3.9-5.6 calculated using varying numbers of days in a sub cohort of PREDICT 1   
240 participants with up to 4 free living days $(\mathrm{n}{=}175)$ ): specifically Spearman's correlations between   
241 glycaemic metrics  (glycaemic variability and TIR3.9-5.6) calculated using 1 vs 4 days, 1 vs 3 days, $2\;\nu s$   
242 2 days, 2 vs 3 days, $2\;\nu s\;4$ days and $3\ \nu s\ 4$ days were explored (Supplementary Figure 1) with good   
243 estimates across all days ranging from rs; $\it{0.65-0.99}$ . Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves   
244 were constructed and ROC-area under the curve (ROC-AUC) was calculated to assess the   
245 discriminatory accuracy of glycaemic metrics to detect ASCVD 10-year risk, Homeostatic Model   
246 Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and glycoprotein acetylation (GlycA) ( $70\%$ applied as   
247 a cut-point). ROC-AUC ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with 0.5 indicating no discrimination, and 1.0 indicating   
248 perfect discrimination. $P\le0.05$ was considered statistically significant.

250 Descriptive characteristics for the PREDICT cohorts are presented in Table 1. Cohorts were   
251 predominantly female (PREDICT 1; $75\%$ , 2; $73\%$ , 3; $88\%$ ) and HbA1c concentrations were below   
252 levels for people living with diabetes $(6.5\%,\,48\;\mathrm{mmol/mol})$ for all cohorts (PREDICT 1; $5.5\pm0.3\%$   
253 (37  mmol⋅mol-1), PREDICT 2; $5.2\pm0.3\%$ $33\,\mathrm{\mmol/mol)}$ , PREDICT 3; $5.2\pm0.5\%$ (33  mmol⋅mol  
254 1)). Mean daily glucose, as measured by CGM, was $4.93\pm0.42$ mmol⋅L-1, $4.99\pm0.42$ mmol⋅L-1  and   
255 $5.19\pm1.11$ mmol⋅L-1 in PREDICT 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

Daily fluctuations in interstitial fluid glucose concentrations under free living conditions are shown in Figure 1A. Median glycaemic variability and TIR3.9-5.6 in PREDICT 1 were $15.8\%$ (IQR 13.2-18.7) and $72.4\%$ (IQR 62.0-80.7) respectively (Figure 2B and 2C and Table 1). Similar glycaemic variability and TIR3.9-5.6  values were observed in PREDICT 2 ( $15.0\%$ [IQR 12.5-17.7] and $76.6\%$ [IQR 66.7-83.9]) and PREDICT 3 ( $14.5\%$ [IQR 12.3-17.2] and $75.7\%$ [IQR 64.6-83.0]). Time spent within and outside ranges are shown in Table 1, with time spent in $1\ \mathrm{mmol{\cdot}L^{-1}}$ incremental glucose concentrations shown in Figure 2F-I. There was large inter-individual variation in glycaemic variability (PREDICT 1: $26.2\%$ ; PREDICT 2: $26.0\%$ and PREDICT $3!\,27.2\%$ ). Inter-individual variability in TIR3.9-5.6 (PREDICT 1: $22.7\%$ ; PREDICT 2: $19.7\%$ and PREDICT $3\colon21.4\%$ ). was higher than that for TIRADA (PREDICT 1: $15.3\%$ ; PREDICT 2: $15.0\%$ and PREDICT 3: $13.0\%$ ).

Spearman’s correlation coefficient between the CGM-derived glycaemic metrics  (Figure 2E) was used to elucidate the degree to which different glycaemic metrics  were related in participants without diabetes (PREDICT 1 cohort only, $\scriptstyle{\mathtt{n}=807}$ ). The strongest correlations between two glycaemic metrics were found between $\mathrm{TIR}_{\mathrm{ADA}}$ and glycaemic variability $r_{\mathrm{s}}=-0.60$ , $95\%$ CI: $-0.65--0.55)$ . Glycaemic variability and TIR3.9-5.6, were modestly inversely correlated $r_{\mathrm{s}}=-0.52$ , $95\%$ CI: $-0.57\mathrm{~--~}0.46)$ . The correlation between mean daily glucose concentration and HbA1c levels was weaker $(r_{\mathrm{s}}=0.15$ , $95\%$ CI: 0.08 – 0.22). HbA1c was also modestly associated with TIR3.9-5.6 $r_{\mathrm{s}}=-0.15$ , $95\%$ CI: -0.22 – -0.08) but not TIRADA $r_{\mathrm{s}}=-0.04$ , $95\%$ CI: -0.14 – 0.00).  

328 Relationship of diet and lifestyle with CGM glycaemic metrics in the PREDICT 1 cohort  

329 To explore the relationship between diet and glycaemic metrics, both habitual (FFQ) and free-living   
330 (logged) dietary data were assessed in PREDICT 1 $\scriptstyle[n=807]$ ). On free-living days with corresponding   
331 CGM data, protein, carbohydrate, and fat intakes (logged diet data derived) contributed on average 15.8   
332 $\pm\,4.9\,\%$ , $43.1\pm10.0\:\%$ and $36.3\pm9.0\;\%$ to total energy intake respectively; mean fibre intake was 4.6   
333 $\pm\,12.6~\mathrm{g}$ total fibre per 1,000 kcal. (Supplementary Table 1).   
334   
335 Higher glycaemic variability was correlated with an unfavourable diet quality index (unhealthy plant   
336 based diet index (uPDI), $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{s}}\colon0.16)$ and higher intakes of carbohydrate $(\%$ energy intake (EI ), $\mathrm{{\bfr}_{s};0.17}$ ),   
337 ultra-processed foods (NOVA $4,\,\%$ EI, $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{s}};0.12\rangle$ , potatoes $(\mathrm{r}_{\mathrm{s}};0.10)$ and sugar-sweetened beverages ${\bf\cal r}_{\mathrm{s}}$ :   
338 0.09) (all $\mathsf{p}<0.05$ , adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and energy) (Figure 3A). Conversely, a lower glycaemic   
339 variability was associated with favourable diet quality indexes (Healthy Eating Index (HEI) $[\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{s}};\,-0.10]$ ,   
340 Mediterranean diet score (aMED) $\left[\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{s}};\,0.16\right]\}$ ), as well as higher intakes of protein $(\%\mathrm{EI},\,\mathrm{r_{s:}}\;-0.13)$ ), fat   
341 (%EI, rs: -0.11), unprocessed foods (NOVA 1, $\%{\mathrm{EI}}$ , $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{s}}\mathrm{:}-0.11\$ ), vegetables $(\mathrm{r_{s}};-0.11)$ and eggs $(\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{s}};\,-0.10$ ,   
342 $\mathtt{p}{<}0.05$ for all). TIR3.9-5.6 was more weakly associated with diet, but was also positively associated with   
343 intakes of protein $(\%\mathrm{EI},\mathrm{r_{s}};0.13)$ and eggs $(\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{s}};0.11)$ and negatively associated with carbohydrate intakes   
344 $(\%\mathrm{EI},~\mathrm{r_{s};~-0.15})$ and unhealthy diet quality (uPDI) $(\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{s}};\mathbf{\nabla}-0.12$ , all $\mathtt{p}{<}0.05)$ . Of note, there were no   
345 significant associations between dietary intake and mean daily interstitial fluid glucose (CGM-derived),   
346 and fasting plasma glucose (venous blood sample) was only associated with habitual alcohol intake.   
347 HbA1c was positively associated with carbohydrate $(\%\mathrm{EI})$ and sugar $(\%\mathrm{EI})$ intake whereas interstitial   
348 glucose concentration 2h post OGTT was not associated with diet (Supplementary Table 1). Higher   
349 habitual carbohydrate intake (FFQ derived) was associated with lower OGTT postprandial glucose   
350 response (1hr concentration) but was inversely correlated with TIR (Figure 3B).   
351   
352 We also examined timing-related free-living dietary habits including number of eating occasions,   
353 cumulative number of main meals and snacks, fasting window (hrs), first and last eating occasion (EO)   
354 (clock time), and eating midpoint (midpoint between first and last EO), whilst adjusting for age, sex,   
355 BMI and energy intake (kcal) (Figure 3C). Longer overnight fasting windows (average duration across   
356 free-living days) were associated with lower glycemic variability $(\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{{s}:}}\mathrel{-}0.10,\,\mathbf{p}=0.01]$ ). The time of the   
357 first EO was positively associated with the fasting window $(\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{s}};0.68)$ , signifying later breakfast leads to   
358 longer fasting duration (Supplementary Table 2). To understand whether commencing the eating   
359 window earlier versus later independent of fasting time was favourable to glycaemia we adjusted for   
360 the fasting window; the time of first EO and last EO were no longer associated with glycaemic   
361 variability and TIR3.9-5.6 after adjustment, respectively. Next, we examined point-in-time analysis,   
362 examining daily glycaemic responses (glycaemic variability and TIR3.9-5.6) with preceding day   
363 overnight fasting windows. Glycaemic variability was inversely associated with the preceding day   
364 fasting window $(\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{s}};-0.08$ , $\mathsf{p}=0.03]$ ). No other associations were evident with the other timing-related   
365 free living dietary habit variables.   
366   
367 TIR3.9-5.6 was inversely associated with activity energy expenditure (AEE, kcal) (rs: -0.09, $\mathsf{p}=0.03$ ), but   
368 not with sleep duration or efficiency (Supplementary Table 3). However, glycaemic variability was   
369 not associated with physical activity or sleep metrics. Mean daily interstitial glucose concentrations   
370 were positively associated with AEE (rs: 0.13, $\mathsf{p}\!<\!0.001]$ ), and negatively associated with sleep duration   
371 (rs: -0.09, $\mathsf{p}=0.02)$ ). HbA1c was negatively correlated with sleep duration only $(\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{{s}}};-0.09,\mathbf{p}=0.02)$ ). No   
372 other associations were evident between glycaemic metrics, physical activity, and sleep.

Stratification of baseline characteristics and clinical markers on TIR and glycaemic variability  

Baseline characteristics and clinical chemistry measurements were stratified based on variation in TIR3.9-5.6 and glycaemic variability, and the top (Q5) and bottom (Q1) quintiles of both glycaemic metrics were compared (Figure 4).  

In the PREDICT 1 cohort, more favourable glycaemic control (i.e. greater TIR3.9-5.6  and lower GV) was associated with younger age (median difference TIR3.9-5.6: 3 y, GV: 6 y), and lower HbA1c (median difference $0.10\%$ ), (median difference TIR3.9-5.6: $0.10~\%$ , GV: $0.10~\%$ ). More favourable glycaemic variability was also associated with higher BMI (median difference TIR3.9-5.6 $0.87~\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ , GV; 2.15 $\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$ , however this relationship did not persist when controlling for energy intake from fat $({\mathsf{p}}>0.05)$ (Figure 4A and 4B). Additionally, lower glycaemic variability was associated with lower HDL-C (by $0.11\,\mathrm{\mmol/L}$ ) (Figure 4B). Triglycerides were not different across groups. Similar trends were observed in the PREDICT 2 and 3 cohorts (Supplementary Figure 2). A linear trend was also found between TIR3.9-5.6 and glycaemic responses to an OGTT (1h and 2h concentrations) (Figure 4C and 4D). Participants $(6\%)$ with TIR ${<}40\%$ had a mean 1h post OGTT glucose of $8.20\ \square\ 2.75\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$ compared to participants $(\%)$ with $\mathrm{TIR}_{3.9-5.6}\geq\!80\%$ who had a 1h post OGTT of $6.95\:\bigtriangleup1.56\:\mathrm{mmol/L}$ .

410 Glycaemic metrics in relation to surrogate health scores   
411 In PREDICT 1, differences in HbA1c, ASCVD 10y risk and HOMA-IR between quintile 1 and quintile   
412 5 of TIR3.9-5.6 were apparent that were not observed between the lower and upper quintiles of TIRADA,   
413 or glycaemic variability (Supplementary Table 5).   
414   
415 The ROC-AUC was compared to examine the extent to which glycaemic metrics $(\mathrm{TIR}_{3.9-5.6}(\%)$ ,,  TIRADA   
416 $(\%)$ , glycaemic variability $\mathrm{(mmol/L)}$ , fasting glucose (mmol/L), and HbA1c $(\%)$ ) could be used to   
417 identify individuals with intermediary cardiometabolic disease risk measures, including ASCVD 10-   
418 year risk (ASCVD cut-off $5\%$ ), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR cut-off 1.9), liver fat probability (cut off   
419 0.23) as well as fasting inflammation (GlycA cut-off $1.4\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$ ) (cut-offs selected based on clinical   
420 guidelines [41, 42]). TIR3.9-5.6 was moderately effective at identifying ASCVD risk $(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}=0.68$   
421 ( $95\%$ CI 0.56-0.80)), HOMA-IR $(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}=0.55$ $(95\%\operatorname{CI}0.44–0.65)$ ), Liver Fat Probability (ROC  
422 $\mathrm{AUC}\,=\,0.59$ ( $95\%$ CI 0.48-0.70)), and inflammation $(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}\,=\,0.62$ ( $95\%$ CI 0.50-0.74)). In   
423 comparison, TIRADA was also moderately effective at identifying ASCVD risk $\left(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}=0.69\,(95\%$   
424 ${\mathrm{CI}}\,0.57{-}0.82)$ ) and HOMA-IR risk $(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}=0.54\$ $(95\%\mathrm{\,CI\,}0.43–0.65))$ ), but was less effective than   
425 TIR3.9-5.6 for identification of Liver Fat Probability $(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}\,=\,0.52$ $95\%$ CI 0.43-0.61)), and   
426 inflammation $(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}=0.48$ $95\%$ CI 0.37-0.59)). Glycaemic variability was less effective in   
427 comparison to TIR3.9-5.6  for identifying HOMA-IR $(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}=0.51$ $(95\%\mathrm{\CI}\ 0.41{-}0.61))$ , Liver Fat   
428 Probability $\mathrm{ROC-AUC}=0.52$ ( $95\%$ CI 0.43-0.61)) and inflammation $(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}=0.53$ $95\%$ CI   
429 0.43-0.63)) , but was moderately effective for identifying ASCVD $(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}=0.68$ ( $95\%$ CI 0.52-   
430 0.84)) (Figure 5). HbA1C was the most effective at identifying risk for ASCVD $(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}=0.71\$   
431 $(95\%$ CI 0.57-0.84)), Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR; $\mathrm{ROC-AUC}\,=\,0.70$ $95\%$ CI 0.61-0.79)) and   
432 inflammation $(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}=0.65$ (0.53-0.77)), but not Liver Fat Probability $(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}=0.53$ $95\%$   
433 CI 0.44-0.63)). Fasting glucose was better than TIR3.9-5.6 for HOMA-IR $\mathrm{\Delta^{/}R O C-A U C=0.75}$ (0.66-0.85),   
434 and was also the strongest predictor of Liver Fat Probability $(\mathrm{ROC-AUC}=0.65$ $95\%$ CI 0.56-0.74)).   
441 These analyses investigated continuous interstitial fluid glucose profiles in participants without diabetes   
442 or impaired glucose tolerance using CGMs. Under free living conditions, median glycaemic variability   
443 (coefficient variation) was $\mathord{\sim}15\%$ , and individuals spent ${\sim}96\%$ of their time with glucose values between   
444 3.9 and $7.8\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$ , compared to $\sim\!75\%$ of time within an exploratory TIR target for people without   
445 diabetes $3.9\textrm{-}5.6\;\mathrm{mmol/L})$ . This exploratory TIR target was sensitive to changes in HOMA-IR and is   
446 discriminatory of ASCVD risk despite normal HbA1c concentrations. Equally, this proposed range was   
447 also associated with diet indices relating to both quantity and quality of foods consumed, as well as   
448 patterns of feeding and fasting.   
449 A more stringent TIR target provides better discriminatory potential than established ranges to   
450 detect changes in cardiometabolic health in individuals without diabetes. In the present study we   
451 found participants across three cohorts spent $\sim95\%$ of their time within the established secondary ADA   
452 TIR target $(3.9{-}7.6\,\mathrm{mmol/L})$ 2. This is in line with a series of previous studies showing that, on average,   
453 metabolically healthy individuals spend $93{-}99\%$ of their time within this range 10-19. However, both   
454 fasting and non-fasting concentrations of glucose $>\!5.6\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$ are associated with increased risk of   
455 diabetes and associated comorbidities highlighting the need to revisit current glycaemic targets for   
456 healthy individuals 20-22. One previous study reports ${\sim}20\%$ of time is spent above $5.6\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$ , while   
457 ${\sim}80\%$ was spent between 3.3 to $5.6\,\mathrm{mmol/L}$ 10; comparatively TIR3.9-5.6 was $\sim\!75\%$ in the current study.   
458 The findings of the current study are in agreement with those of Keshet et al 19 in reporting associations   
459 between glycaemic metrics and markers of CVD risk. Comparison of upper and lower quintiles of   
460 TIR3.9-5.6 revealed differences in HbA1c, ASCVD 10y risk and HOMA-IR, that were otherwise not   
461 observed using TIRADA. This hints at the potential superior discriminatory potential of utilising a   
462 stringent TIR in a population without diabetes or IGT; in the case of HOMA-IR, this might suggest   
463 CGM could be a useful tool for identifying insulin sensitivity without the need to measure insulin,   
464 however further work is required to confirm this. The current study further builds on the work of Keshet   
465 et al 19 through assessment of responses to standardised OGTT. A longer time spent in stringent ranges   
466 was associated with a linear decrease in glucose concentrations away from unfavourable diagnostic   
467 ranges for both a 2h and 1h OGTT glucose concentrations. For the latter, glucose $\geq\!8.5\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$ is   
468 suggested to be predictive of diabetes progression and increased risk for microvascular disease and   
469 mortality 41, whereas for the former, a 2 h postprandial glucose above fasting is associated with coronary   
470 heart disease and ischemic stroke in individuals with normo-glycaemia 8. Collectively these data suggest   
471 that CGMs may be useful in early identification of changes in intermediary cardiometabolic disease   
472 risk measures, such as ASCVD and HOMA-IR, which typically precede changes in most other risk   
473 measures 42. In turn this may help to prevent development of impaired glucose tolerance as well as   
474 progression to prediabetes and diabetes 4,41.   
75 Lower carbohydrate intake is associated with improved daily glycaemic variability, but chronic   
76 low carbohydrate intake may reduce measured glucose tolerance. Under controlled conditions,   
77 postprandial glucose responses are dependent on both physiological factors (insulin secretion, insulin   
78 sensitivity and glucose effectiveness) as well as dietary intake (carbohydrate content and glycaemic   
79 index of foods) and contextual factors (sleep, physical activity, stress, time of day) 43. In free living   
80 settings, large day-to-day variability exists in dietary intake as individuals consume different food   
81 combinations in varying amounts at random times and meals are consumed in different proximity to   
82 other meals, overnight fasting, physical activity and sleep 23,25. To understand some of the complexity   
83 in dietary data we examined both habitual and free-living dietary intakes in relation to glycaemic   
84 variability and TIR3.9-5.6. Protein intake was positively associated with TIR3.9-5.6 and inversely associated   
85 with glycaemic variability, agreeing with previous evidence showing beneficial effects of protein on   
86 glycaemic outcomes 19,24,44. Logged carbohydrate intake was negatively associated with TIR3.9-5.6 and   
87 positively associated with glucose variability suggesting that the greater carbohydrate intake worsens   
88 daily glycaemic responses, consistent with Keshet et al 19. Habitual carbohydrate intake, on the other   
489 hand, was negatively correlated with 1-h postprandial glucose during an OGTT, further highlighting   
90 the relationship between habitual carbohydrate intake and improved measured glucose tolerance 45-50.   
91 Taken together, these data demonstrate the uncoupling of dietary factors between OGTT-derived versus   
92 CGMs-derived glycaemic metrics suggesting that acute exchange of carbohydrate with protein is   
93 associated with lower glycaemic variability, but chronic adaptation to such diets may not reflect acute   
94 responses.   
5 Food preparation and processing techniques have also been shown to influence postprandial glycaemic   
6 responses, due to modifications of starch structures and the food matrix 26,51. However, to the best of   
7 our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate an association between intake of NOVA classified   
8 “ultra-processed” foods and glycaemic variability. More specifically, intake of NOVA category 1 foods   
9 was inversely associated with glycaemic variability, intake of NOVA category 4 foods was positively   
0 associated with glycaemic variability. Furthermore, habitual intake of sugar-sweetened beverages   
1 positively correlated with glycaemic variability, yet there was no clear evidence of a correlation   
02 between habitual sugar intake per se and glycaemic variability. This supports the hypothesis that the   
03 types of foods ingested mediate the glycaemic responses to sugars, however further work is required to   
4 establish the exact mechanisms of this effect. These data add to the growing body of literature   
5 suggesting that foods are not the simple sum of their nutrients and quality, processing and formulation   
6 are essential considerations when characterizing foods and considering their effects on health.   
7 Cycles of feeding and fasting influence daily glycaemic variability. Longer nocturnal fasting   
08 duration was associated with lower glucose coefficient of variation (Supplementary Table 3). This is   
9 consistent with the long/late eating windows and may suggest a shorter eating window is associated   
10 with favourable daily glycaemic variability 52,53. Several time restricted eating (TRE) studies in adults   
1 have demonstrated improvement in glycaemic metrics such as mean daily glucose, fasting glucose, and   
2 postprandial glycaemic responses compared to those eating over prolonged time windows 54-57;   
13 however, others have found no TRE treatment effect on glycaemic metrics 58-61, or worsened glycaemic   
14 variability 62. This may be related to the time of day in which eating and/or periods occur 23,62; none  
5 the-less further investigation is warranted to determine the exact mechanism of these inconsistencies.   
6 Future research incorporating additional elements of the diet such as fasting/feeding windows into   
7 dietary recommendations may provide additional avenues through which glycaemic health can be   
8 maintained.   
19 Finally, we explored the relationship between physical activity and sleep with TIR and glycaemic   
20 variability. Greater activity energy expenditure (AEE; kcal) was associated with lower TIR. This was   
21 surprising given the established effects of physical activity on improving TIR and GV in individuals   
22 with T2D 63,64. However there are several potential explanations for a lack of effect in the current study.   
23 Firstly, a ceiling effect of physical activity may exist in non-diabetic individuals whereby little   
24 additional improvement is seen with increasing activity energy expenditure on top of the improvement   
25 in glycaemic regulation seen from reducing sedentary time 64,65. Secondly, it is possible that activity   
26 levels on free-living days were not reflective of those typically seen in the study cohort, due to the   
27 intensive testing protocol in PREDICT 1 28. Nevertheless, mean daily interstitial glucose concentration   
28 was positively associated with AEE, however the causality of this relationship is not clear and future   
29 research should establish whether high levels of physical activity drive higher glucose levels or vice   
30 versa.   
531 Our previous work revealed the effects of sleep duration on the acute glycaemic responses (2h iAUC)   
532 to set meals measured consumed under standardised conditions using CGMs 25. The current study   
533 therefore extends on this by exploring the influence of both sleep duration and sleep efficiency on whole   
534 day glycaemic metrics under free-living conditions. Neither sleep duration nor efficiency were related   
535 to TIR and GV but mean interstitial glucose concentration was inversely related to both sleep metrics.   
536 Taken together this might suggest that whilst lack of sleep perturbs the underlying physiology that   
537 regulates glycaemic control 66,67, the influence of behavioural factors may attenuate dysregulated blood   
538 glucose control in a free living context 68.   
539 Limitations of this analysis include: 1) cross-sectional data preventing identification of causal   
540 relationships; 2) low number of free living days of CGM data; 3); no data on female menstrual cycle   
541 status, which may influence insulin sensitivity and therefore indirectly TIR, 4) some participants were   
542 unblinded to CGM results which potentially biased CV and TIR metrics from PREDICT 2 and 3   
543 cohorts. The data presented examines markers of cardiometabolic health, postprandial metabolism,   
544 metabolic syndrome factors, and diet across the deeply phenotyped PREDICT 1 cohort.   
545 In summary, individuals with normo-glycaemia spend $\sim\!75\%$ of their time within a stringent range of   
546 interstitial glucose concentrations $(3.9{-}5.6\;\mathrm{mmol/L})$ compared to ${\sim}96\%$ of time within the established   
547 ADA normative glucose range $(3.9{-}7.8\,\mathrm{mmol/L})$ ). This stringent time in range target provides sensitivity   
548 to detect changes in HOMA-IR, ASCVD 10 y risk and HbA1c that ADA targets are otherwise unable   
549 to. Additional novel associations among TIR, glycaemic variability and aspects of diet and lifestyle   
550 (e.g. NOVA 4 categorisation, protein intake,  nocturnal fasting duration) were also observed which   
551 highlight potential dietary strategy targets to improve glycaemic metrics derived from continuous   
552 glucose monitors.

LLM-agnostic semantic-search library with hybrid search support and multiple backends.

## Features

- üîç Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword search
- üöÄ Multiple backend support (Meilisearch, more coming soon)
- üìÑ Smart document splitting with semantic awareness
- üîå LLM-agnostic - works with any embedding model
- üéØ Optimized for scientific and technical content
- üõ† Easy to use API and CLI tools

## Installation

Make sure you have at least Python 3.11 installed.

### Using pip

```bash
pip install just-semantic-search        # Core package
pip install just-semantic-search-meili  # Meilisearch backend
```

### Using Poetry

```bash
poetry add just-semantic-search        # Core package
poetry add just-semantic-search-meili  # Meilisearch backend
```

### From Source

```bash
# Install Poetry if you haven't already
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/just-semantic-search.git
cd just-semantic-search

# Install dependencies and create virtual environment
poetry install

# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell
```

### Docker Setup for Meilisearch

The project includes a Docker Compose configuration for running Meilisearch. Simply run:

```bash
./bin/meili.sh
```

This will start a Meilisearch instance with vector search enabled and persistent data storage.

## Quick Start

### Document Splitting

```python
from just_semantic_search.article_semantic_splitter import ArticleSemanticSplitter
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Initialize model and splitter
model = SentenceTransformer('thenlper/gte-base')
splitter = ArticleSemanticSplitter(model)

# Split document with metadata
documents = splitter.split_file(
    "path/to/document.txt",
    embed=True,
    title="Document Title",
    source="https://source.url"
)
```

### Hybrid Search with Meilisearch

```python
from just_semantic_search.meili.rag import MeiliConfig, MeiliRAG

# Configure Meilisearch
config = MeiliConfig(
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port=7700,
    api_key="your_api_key"
)

# Initialize RAG
rag = MeiliRAG(
    "test_index",
    "thenlper/gte-base",
    config,
    create_index_if_not_exists=True
)

# Add documents and search
rag.add_documents_sync(documents)
results = rag.search(
    text_query="What are CAD-genes?",
    vector=model.encode("What are CAD-genes?")
)
```

## Project Structure

The project consists of multiple components:

- `core`: Core interfaces for hybrid search implementations
- `meili`: Meilisearch backend implementation


## Testing

### Manual testing

For manual testing we provide manual.py script that allows to test different cases.

To fill in the text index you should use index-folder command.

```bash
poetry shell
python test/meili/manual.py index-folder
```

After the index is filled you can test the search cases.
The index-folder command checks if meili serve is available and if not starts it by running ./bin/meili.sh under the hood.

#### Test search

```bash
python test/meili/manual.py test-search
```
This test contains two cases:
1. RSID test
2. Comics superheroes test

##### RSID test
There are text pieces deliberately incorporated into tacutu papers data ( /data/tacutopapers_test_rsids_10k ) In particular for rs123456789 and rs123456788 as well as similar but misspelled rsids are added to the documents:

10.txt contains both two times
11.txt contains both one time
12.txt and 13 contain only one rsid
20.txt contains both wrong rsids two times
21.txt contains both wrong rsids one time
22.txt and 23 contain only one wrong rsid

##### Comics superheroes test
Also, similar test for "Comics superheroes" that will test embeddings:

Only 114 document has text about superheroes, but text did not contain words 'comics' or 'superheroes'

## Indexing example hugginfa S2ORC datasets

We uploaded many papers from S2ORC dataset as parquet files. As those papers are already split into paragraphs, we use paragraph splitters.
You can try it out with the following command:

```bash
poetry shell
python scholar/just_semantic_search/scholar/paperset.py index --index-name paperset --df-name-or-path hf://datasets/longevity-genie/tacutu_papers/tacutu_pubmed.parquet --model-name gte-large
```

By default it does not use semantic similarity threshold so it will split by maximum token length. However, you can specify similarity threshold as -s parameters to split by semantic similarity but it is very slow.
If you add --recreate-index it will clean the index before adding which is useful for testing.

You can also try to index all ageing research papers from Semantic Scholar dataset but it will take days to complete:
```bash
python scholar/just_semantic_search/scholar/paperset.py index --recreate-index --index-name paperset --df-name-or-path hf://datasets/longevity-genie/aging_papers_paragraphs/aging_specific_pubmed.parquet --model-name gte-large
```
